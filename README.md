## Description

Ledger is a full-stack web application created with Django and ReactJS. Ledger is integrated with the [Plaid API](https://plaid.com/docs/api/) to allow users to connect with their bank accounts. Once connected with their bank accounts, users will be able to see their total balance, a list of transactions, and statistics/graphs of their most spent-on categories.
